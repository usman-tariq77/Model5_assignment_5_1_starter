## Observations

Overall observerations for acceptance rates as below, ranked from highest to lowest:

- Carry Out - Take away: 74%
- Restaurant <20: 71%
- Coffee House: 50%
- Restaurant 20-50: 44%
- Bar: 41%

### Observation for the bar coupons

- While bar coupons were the second least accepted coupon in this data set. 
- The overall acceptance rate was 41% the highest acceptance rates came from cars with no kid passengers and not widowed and folks that go to cheap restaurants with income less than 50k.
- Lowest acceptance rate unsurprisingly came from users who go to bars fewer than 3 times a month. 

### Observations for Coffee House coupons

- The overall acceptance rate pf 49.92% is good compared to bar coupon types. 
- Users were even on acceptance and rejection of the coupons across both genders for the coffee.
- Higher acceptance rates in single people compared to unmarried and married people.
- Most Coupon acceptances came from folks holding no degrees and bachelor degree while most bachelor degree holders declined the coupon majority of the no degree holders accepted it.
- The highest acceptance rate was at 10 am second highest being around 2 pm which is not surprising as most folks would be looking for a boost at this time. The surprise is the 2 highest rejections come at 7 am and 6pm, 7am should be the coffee time for most folks, so more investigation is needed. 
- Coffee coupons were accepted across the income spectrum except the 75k-84k range, might be a data anomaly to look deeper into. The income range between 25k-37.5k with the highest rejection is interesting so decided to look into it deeper, seems like much higher rate of rejection for both Married and Unmarried folks in this income range compared to acceptance. Digging into the education levels for this income range yields similar results with much higher rejection rates across all cases except graduate degree holders and looking into the time based data highlights that the only 2 times where acceptance was more than rejection was at 10 am and 2 pm all other times had higher rejection compared to approval. 
- Most folks chose to accept coupons when riding with Friends and Partners, interestingly the lowest acceptance being when driving alone.
